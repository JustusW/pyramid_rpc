Action Message Format RPC
=========================

Action Message Format (AMF) is a binary format used for serializing
ActionScript objects. It's primarily used for communication between Flash and
a server, though it can be used from clients in other languages as well.

AMF support is provided by utilizing the `PyAMF package <http://pyamf.org/index.html>`_.
