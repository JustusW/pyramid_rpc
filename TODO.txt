pyramid_rpc README
==================

- Support system.* XML-RPC API Methods and introspection
- Deprecate old-style double-dispatch in jsonrpc and xmlrpc.
- Add support for batching requests via tweens.
- Add support for traversal via '{rpc_method}' pattern to allow
  fine-grained security based on the rpc method or possible params.
- Add decorator versions of the add_method calls (i.e. @jsonrpc_method
  as an alias for config.add_jsonrpc_method).
